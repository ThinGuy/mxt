# This tag will identify a machine with proper that CPU tags,
# cores, and RAM and tag them as hypervisor
#
# Note: Adjust cores and RAM (in bytes) to suit your needs
#       This example looks for 40 cores and 256 GB of RAM and has all the required CPU features for being a hypervisor
#       for both Intel and AMD
